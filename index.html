          <h1>Code Display - Check whether a graph is bipartite</h1>
      <blockquote>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets {\displaystyle U}U and {\displaystyle V}V such that every edge connects a vertex in {\displaystyle U}U to one in {\displaystyle V}V.
           Vertex sets {\displaystyle U}U and {\displaystyle V}V are usually called the parts of the graph. 
           Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd-length cycles.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph">Click Here</a>
